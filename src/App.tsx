I just wanted to say that I am very proud of you for being so strong and optimistic throughout it all. I hope that 2025 is the year where you overcome cancer and make it just a past struggle. I also hope that you are happy, healthy, and successful during this year. I will always love you and Merry Christmas!",

I hope that 2025 is the year where you hopefully only have to move once. I also hope that it is a healthy, happy, and successful year for you and that you are able to get whatever you wish. I love you a lot and wish you a Merry Christmas!",

I hope that 2024 was a good year for you and that 2025 will be an even better year for you, especially since you are finally done with university.  I know that it is a big transition in your life and you don’t know what the next step in your life is, but I hope that whatever you end up doing is successful and brings a lot of joy. Particularly studying and actually doing the MCAT as it is probably going to be really hard but I know you are going to do great. Merry Christmas and I love you 300 ❤️",
